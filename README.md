# Code-Mixing-Translation

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Most translators that we find on web are used to translate one language to another, then what if a person speaks a bilingual conversationâ€¦? It translates one language and leaves the unrecognized words unchanged. This problem occurs while translating a real-time conversation as we use words of different languages when we speak. So, in order to solve this problem we are working on this project.</p>
