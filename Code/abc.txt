An English professor
wrote the words:

“A woman without her man is nothing”
on the chalkboard and asked the students
to punctuate it correctly.

All of the males in the class wrote:
“A woman, without her man, is nothing.”

All of the females in the class wrote:
“A woman: without her, man is nothing.”

Punctuation is powerful.
